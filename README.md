# Stock-price-prediction-model
This code predicts Tesla's stock price using historical data from `yfinance`. It normalizes the 'Close' price and prepares sequences of the past 60 days as input for an LSTM model. The model is trained, tested, and evaluated using RMSE. Predicted vs. actual prices are visualized, highlighting model performance.
